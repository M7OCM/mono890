#Mono890 Radtel RT-890 custom firmware Series 4

Binary file archive of my recent RT-890 custom firmware for PCB2.0 and PCB2.1.

Use at own risk, my personal project, back up SPI before proceeding, no warranty anything works, may destroy your radio but never has mine and I've got lots many with hundreds of firmware revisions!

Its a figure it out yourself approach. Strictly no requests, source available soon for further tinkering.

No colour versions strictly mono for reduced SPI interference from screen updates. Works better outside too. RSSI refresh rate reduced plus some great additions from developer [motorello](https://github.com/motorello/RT-890-OEFW-more)

I'll try and get some documentation together but disclaimer might not happen - in true amateur tradition experiment is key, none of this it doesn't work it does sure there are plenty of hardware issues to contend with but the 890 is a decent enough cheap radio to play with.

73 for now
