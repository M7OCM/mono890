Radtel RT-890 custom firmware Series 4.

30 Nov 2025 Binary file archive of my recent RT-890 custom firmware for PCB2.0 and PCB2.1. It's the firmware I currently use on both boards. Note previous VHF issues with older PCB2.1 firmware was resolved a long time ago (V3.2 on Radtels website). Thanks to Marcus Dudley and Kelvin.

Use at own risk, my personal project, back up SPI before proceeding, no warranty anything works, may destroy your radio but never has mine and I've got lots - many with hundreds of firmware revisions installed!

Its a figure it out yourself approach. Strictly no requests, source available soon for further tinkering.

This may be a one off update so don't expect lots of updates if any.

No colour versions (shock horror!) strictly mono for reduced interference from screen updates. Works better outside too. RSSI refresh rate reduced plus some great additions from developer [motorello](https://github.com/motorello/RT-890-OEFW-more)

I'll try and get some documentation together - disclaimer might not happen - in true amateur tradition... experiment lol

See 890 and 890 II repos for basic instructions.
